# MS-SSIM-L1-For-1D

Implementation of MS-SSIM + L1 loss proposed in [Loss Functions for Neural Networks for Image Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08861) for greyscale images (originally meant for RGB images).

The pytorch implementation is done [here](https://github.com/psyrocloud/MS-SSIM_L1_LOSS/tree/main), and the original implementation in caffe is [here](https://github.com/NVlabs/PL4NN).
